# Fullstack Interview Challenge

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should have received a google doc together with this repository that explains in detail the scope and context of the exercise, together with it's acceptance criteria and any other necessary information for the completion of the challenge.

## Context

You are working in the product team at eversports that is maintaining the eversports manager. You and your team are working on a bunch of features around memberships within the current quarter.

The team also started an initiative in this quarter to modernize the codebase by refactoring features implemented in an old technology stack to a more modern one.  

### Domain: Memberships

A `Membership` allows a user to participate in any class at a specific sport venue within a specific timespan. Within this timespan, the membership is divided into `MembershipPeriods`. The `MembershipPeriods` represent billing periods that the user has to pay for.

For the scope of this exercise, the domain model was reduced to a reasonable size.

#### Entity: Membership

```ts
interface Membership {
    name: string // name of the membership
    user: number // the user that the membership is assigned to
    recurringPrice: number // price the user has to pay for every period
    validFrom: Date // start of the validity
    validUntil: Date // end of the validity
    state: string // indicates the state of the membership
    paymentMethod: string // which payment method will be used to pay for the periods
    billingInterval: string // the interval unit of the periods
    billingPeriods: number // the number of periods the membership has
}
```

#### Entity: MembershipPeriod

```ts
interface MembershipPeriod {
    membership: number // membership the period is attached to
    start: Date // indicates the start of the period
    end: Date // indicates the end of the period
    state: string
}
```

## Task 1 - Modernization of the membership codebase (backend only)

Before your team can start to implement new features, you guys decided to **modernize the backend codebase** first.

Your task is to **refactor two endpoints** implemented in the **legacy codebase** that can be used to list and create memberships:

GET /legacy/memberships (`src/legacy/routes/membership.routes.js`)
POST /legacy/memberships (`src/legacy/routes/membership.routes.js`)

Your new implementation should be accessible through new endpoints in the **modern codebase** that are already prepared:

GET /memberships (`src/modern/routes/membership.routes.ts`)
POST /memberships (`src/modern/routes/membership.routes.ts`)

When refactoring, you should consider the following aspects:

- The response from the endpoints should be exactly the same. Use the same error messages that are used in the legacy implementation.
- You write read- and maintainable code
- You use Typescript instead of Javascript to enabled type safety
- Your code is separated based on concerns
- Your code is covered by automated tests to ensure the stability of the application

> [!NOTE]
> For the scope of this task, the data used is mocked within the json files `membership.json` and `membership-periods.json`

> [!NOTE]
> We provided you with an clean express.js server to run the example. For your implementations, feel free to use any library out there to help you with your solution. If you decide to choose another JavaScript/TypeScript http library/framework (eg. NestJs) update the run config described below if needed, and ensure that the routes of the described actions don't change.

## Task 2 - Design an architecture to provide a membership export (conception only)

The team discovered that users are interested in **exporting all of their memberships** from the system to run their own analysis once a month as a **CSV file**. Because the creation of the export file would take some seconds, the team decided to go for an **asynchronous process** for creating the file and sending it via email. The process will be triggered by an API call of the user.

Your task is to **map out a diagram** that visualizes the asynchronous process from receiving the request to sending the export file to the user. This diagram should include all software / infrastructure components that will be needed to make the process as stable and scalable as possible.

Because the team has other things to work on too, this task is timeboxed to **1 hour** and you should share the architecture diagram as a **PDF file**.

> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to use any tool out there to create your diagram. If you are not familiar with such a tool, you can use <www.draw.io>.

## Repository Intro

In this repository you will find an plain express.js server the exposes API endpoints to consumers. For this exercise, the API endpoints are not protected.

### Installation

```sh
npm install
```

### Usage

```sh
npm run start
```

### Run test

```sh
npm run test
```

## üóíÔ∏è Conditions

- You will have multiple days for the challenge, but most of our candidates spend around **8h to 10h** on this assignment.
- You should put your code in GitHub or GitLab/Bitbucket and send us the link to your repository where we can find the source code. That means no ZIP files.
- Please make sure to include any additional instructions in a readme in case you change something about the compilation or execution of the codebase.

## üíª Technologies

We believe that great developers are not bound to a specific technology set, but no matter their toolbox they are able to think critically about how to structure and design good code. For this exercise, we provided just a small and simple set of tools to run the a application and tests. Feel free to use any library out there to help you with your implementation.

### Pre-installed

- Express - <https://expressjs.com/>
- TypeScript - <https://www.typescriptlang.org/>
- Jest - <https://jestjs.io/>

Best of luck and looking forward to what you are able to accomplish! üôÇ

## ü™≤ Bugs

In general to resolve API bugs I would proceed (roughly) as follows:

1. check if un-allowed values already exist in the database (e.g. `billingInterval` with value `weekly` or `billingPeriods` with value `2 years`) ... maybe customers already rely on this behavior?

1. check logs if requests with values that should be allowed are being sent and if customers are working around the issue (e.g. memberships with a 4 year period, splitting memberships, etc), check if support tickets have been opened

1. check why these restrictions were put in place in the first place and if they are still valid

1. check if a missing feature (e.g. periods in `GET /memberships`) is being relied on, to determine if it should be added or removed

1. check with API consumers about usage patterns and if they are relying on undocumented behavior

- `GET /memberships` does not return the periods of the memberships. Added a failing test for this.
- README states `user` in `Membership`, data uses `userId`
- `paymentMethod` in `Membership` can also be `null`
- list memberships also returns `id`, `uuid`, `assignedBy` undocumented properties
- `assignedBy` is not set in create membership
- `billingInterval` in `Membership` can also be `weekly` but is not allowed in create membership
- `billingPeriods` with a monthly interval is not correctly checked for the minimum of 6 months

## ü§î Assumptions

- as seen in the data `validUntil` & `validFrom` in `Membership` and `start` & `end` in `MembershipPeriod` are dates and not datetimes. Although timezones should probably be considered.

## üóíÔ∏è Notes

- Added Github actions to run tests on every push
- Installed [`@biomejs/biome`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@biomejs/biome) for linting and formatting
- API has no authentication, out of scope for this exercise
- Added [`http-status-codes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-status-codes) for better handling of HTTP status codes
- Added [`date-fns`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns) for better date handling


- `validUntil` calculation is unclear ... should `2023-01-01` + 12 months be `2024-01-01` (as in code) or `2023-12-31` (as in sample data)?
- should `validUntil` and `validFrom` be inclusive or exclusive?
- should `validUntil` and `validFrom` be dates or datetimes?
- realistically input validation should be done using `zod` or json schema but I left it out for simplicity

## TODOs

- [ ] Decide what to do about missing periods in the `GET /memberships` endpoint
- [ ] Decide what to do about `user` vs `userId` in `Membership`
